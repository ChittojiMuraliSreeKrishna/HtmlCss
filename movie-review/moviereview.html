        <h1>REAL STEEL</h1>
        <h2>- Shawn Levy</h2>

        <p>
            Real Steel is a 2011 American science-fiction sports film starring Hugh Jackman
            and Dakota Goyo and co-produced and directed by Shawn Levy for DreamWorks Pictures.
            The film is based on the short story "Steel", written by Richard Matheson,
            which was originally published in the May 1956 edition of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction,
            and later adapted into a 1963 Twilight Zone episode. Real Steel was in development for several years
            before production began on June 24, 2010. Filming took place primarily in the U.S. state of Michigan.
            Animatronic robots were built for the film, and motion capture technology was used to depict
            the rodeo brawling of computer-generated robots and animatronics, respectively.

            <p>
                Based on Richard Matheson's 1956 short story "Steel." The original screenplay was written by Dan Gilroy
                and was purchased by DreamWorks for $850,000 in 2003 or 2005 (sources differ).
                The project was one of 17 that DreamWorks took from Paramount Pictures when they split in 2008.
                Director Peter Berg expressed interest in the project in mid-2009 but went no further.
                Levy was attached to the project in September 2009, and Jackman was cast in the starring role in November
                for a $9 million fee. In the same month, Steven Spielberg and Stacey Snider at DreamWorks greenlit
                the project. Les Bohem and Jeremy Leven had worked on Gilroy's screenplay, but in 2009 John Gatins
                was working on a new draft. When Levy joined the project, he worked with Gatins to revise the screenplay,
                spending a total of six weeks fine-tuning the script. Advertising company FIVE33 did  about robot boxing.
                Levy said he was invited by Spielberg and Snider while finishing Date Night, and while the director
                initially considered Real Steel to have "a crazy premise," he accepted after reading the script and
                feeling it could be "a really humanistic sports drama.

            <img src="images/download.jpeg" alt="Real Steel" class="movie-plot">
            <p>
                In 2020, human boxers have been replaced by robots. Charlie Kenton, a former boxer, owns "Ambush", but loses it in a fight against a bull belonging to promoter and carnival owner Ricky, who rigged the fight to mess with Charlie due to seeing him as a joke, partially because he beat him up the last time they competed for bailing on the bet. Having made a bet that Ambush would win as a result, Charlie now has a debt to Ricky he can't pay—which he runs out on.

                After the fight, Charlie learns that his ex-girlfriend died and he must attend a hearing deciding the future of their son, Max Kenton, whom Charlie has had almost zero contact with and complete apathy towards since he was born. There, Max's aunt, Debra, and her wealthy husband, Marvin, request full custody, which Charlie concedes for $100,000, half in advance, on the condition that Charlie retains Max for three months while they are on vacation and the other half when they return. Thereupon, Charlie, Max, and Bailey Tallet, the daughter of Charlie's former boxing coach, acquire the once-famous "Noisy Boy", but it is destroyed in a subsequent fight against "Midas". As he and Charlie attempt to scavenge parts to make a new robot from a junkyard, Max discovers "Atom", an obsolete but intact sparring robot designed to withstand severe damage, and can mirror opponent and handler movements and store them in its memory due to its rare "shadow function".

                At Max's behest, Charlie pits Atom against "Metro", whom Atom overcomes. Max programs Noisy Boy's vocal-respond controls in Atom, and convinces Charlie to help him with Atom's fighting move memory, resulting in a series of victories and culminating to being offered a fight in World Robot Boxing against national champion "Twin Cities". After reaching the arena, the owner of global champion "Zeus" offers to buy Atom, which Max instantly rejects. Charlie disagrees, but eventually takes Max's side. The fight starts with Atom on the attack, but Twin Cities easily takes the offensive and corners Atom. While their opponent has no blind spot, Charlie notices a hitch whenever Twin Cities throws a right jab. Using this, Charlie is able to get Atom out of the corner and eventually win by knockout. Elated by their success, Max challenges Zeus, publicly, with the audience squarely on their side.
